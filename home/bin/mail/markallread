# A script to mark all maildir mail as read in the current directory. I use
# this to move getmail's new messages (downloaded to 'new') into 'cur', and add
# a 'seen' flag, before I feed them into notmuch. Useful for archiving (e.g.) a
# GMail account.

for i in `ls -1 ./new/*`
do
  # Move from /new/ to /cur/
  # Also add status "seen" to message by appending :2,S to filename
  # as per http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html
  mv $i `echo $i | sed -r "s/^(.*)\/new\/(.*)$/\1\/cur\/\2:2,S/"`
done
